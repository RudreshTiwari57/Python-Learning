# To print something in python we use python in built function "print()"


# Syntax of print():
# printing "helloworld" in python
print("hello world")

# we can also print multipal values using "," in python
print("hello","world","hello","user")

# printing "hello world hello user" in single line using two print statements

print("hello world",end="")
print("hello user")

#even if developer don't write "end" python itself put "end" in the print statements with default value of "\n"
# which is new line character
