# --------------------------- Escape Characters ---------------------------------------------------
#     To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
#     An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
# An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
#     \'	Single Quote:
print('It\'s alright.')

#     \\	Backslash
print("This will insert one \\ (backslash).")

#     \n	New Line
print("Hello\nWorld!")

#     \r	Carriage Return
print( "Hello\rWorld!")

#     \t	Tab
print("Hello\tWorld!")

#     \b	Backspace
print("Hello \bWorld!")
